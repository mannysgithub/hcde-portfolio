          <h1> Manny's HCDE 598 Portfolio</h1>

          <p> Hello, my name is Manny Zetino and I am first year Masters student in the Human Centered Design and Enginnering program. From 9-5 you
          can find me doing user research at Xbox. Before transitioning to user experience I worked both clinically and in a research setting with kids on the autism spectrum. While I do 
          miss working with kids, I would love to one day bring together my experience in autism and user experience. I love video games, sports, airports, architecture, and food. I watch more TV than anyone
          really should, but that's okay. This is my first attempt at learning to code so stick around and maybe something cool will appear in the next 10 weeks. </p>
