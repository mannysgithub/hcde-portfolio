        <h1> Manny's HCDE 598 Portfolio</h1>

        <p> Hello, my name is Manny Zetino and I am first year Masters student in the Human Centered Design and Enginnering program. 

          This is my first attempt at learning to code so stick around and maybe something cool will appear in the next 10 weeks. </p>
